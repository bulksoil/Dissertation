\abstract{Soil microbes are important mediators of plant nutrition, growth, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, thus understanding the composition and dynamics of plant root-associated microbial communities is of importance to scientists and farmers. Plants acquire root-associated microbiota that are distinct from that of the surrounding soil. In this thesis I detail general characteristics of the rice root-associated microbiota. 

In the first chapter I introduce the importance of both animal and plant microbiota and I discuss the technological breakthroughs that have allowed scientists to study complex microbial ecosystems. 

In the second chapter, I present the results of a study characterizing the rice root-associated microbiota across three root compartments: the soil adjacent to the root (the rhizosphere), the root surface (the rhizoplane), and the root interior (the endosphere). I present how the composition of the microbiota in these compartments varies across soil type, cultivation practice, and host plant genotype. 

In the third chapter, I present the results of a study characterizing the rice root-associated microbiota compared to diverse species of both crop plants and native plants growing in the same environment as rice. The results suggest that rice assimilates a unique root-associated microbiota and that plant phylogenetic variation cannot fully explain microbiota variation between the tested host plants. A comparison of the root-associated microbiomes of rice with microbiota of soil from cultivated fields and non-cultivated soils, suggests that rice cultivation changes the overall soil microbiome in rice fields not only through agricultural inputs and water submergence, but also through specific enrichment of microbial taxa by rice plants. 

In the fourth chapter, I demonstrate how the rice root-associated microbiota shifts across the lifecycle of the host plants under field conditions. We find that the composition of the microbiome shifts throughout vegetative growth until the initiation of reproductive growth, whereupon the microbiome stabilizes. These results suggest that plants select for different microbiota as they undergo developmental changes from germination to reproduction. 

I present concluding remarks on the various models of microbiota acquisition and discuss future implications of this research in the fifth and final chapter of this dissertation.
